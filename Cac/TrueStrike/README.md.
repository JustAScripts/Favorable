 UGC code After pasting it
 Click the Redeem button
   Below the Second colum

       and U got it.

          i added Some new Notification
            as error and successful indicator
              if ur code is Max Usage there's
                 black Text gonna appear below
                   that is the response
                      if the code failed 
                        it gonna response
                          successful : False
                            and whatever error response
                              is it likely code is max usage
                                or u spam it
                                  also if the Redeem button
                                    turn into Red when u click
                                      it Means The code Is Invalid
                                        or u didn't put the group id
                                          or just check in Console by
                                            typing /Console in chat
                                              or some executor have their
                                                own console and the error
                                                  output there.

                                                    also when u execute the script
                                                     there's output in console teach u 
                                                       how to make it work but this read me
                                                         is complete.

                                                           now time for those original Owner Ideas.
                                                             the idea come from Feliz from DeathSniper
                                                               and i modified it with new code and gui
                                                                  if u want to use the original her
                     loadstring(game:HttpGet(("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TrueStrikes/redblue/main/cacc.lua")))()
                                                                     copy the line 55 and that's all i can
                                                                       say also idk why i made this indent like this
                                                                        just don't mind it
